The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
